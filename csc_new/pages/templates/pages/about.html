			I'm a third-year CS major / Economics minor from Summit, NJ.
			I have been a part of the CSC since my first year at RIT, and I've served as the club's PR head ever since.
			As PR, I handle all CSC posters and other club media, as well as interactions with companies and other organizations.
			In other news, I'm a big anime nut, a reformed gamer, and a fan of tennis / dodgeball / volleyball.
