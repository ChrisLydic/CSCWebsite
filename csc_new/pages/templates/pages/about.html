		<h2>Katie Hipkin</h2>
		<p><i>President</i></p>
		<p>I am a third-year Computer Science student from Cranford, NJ.
			I love anime, puzzles, board games, and puns.
			This is my third year in the CSC!!  I started off as the Events Coordinator, moved up to VP, and now I'm the President!
			I'm really excited about this semester because the CSC is going through some *huge* organizational changes!!
			In the coming semester, get ready to see clearer membership guidelines, the launch of subcommittees, lots of Teacher Talks from GCCIS professors, and much more!</p>

		<h2>Christopher Sprague</h2>
		<p><i>Public Relations</i></p>
		<p>You can call me Chris! Born May 28 '94, lived all of my waking life in New Jersey, just within walking distance of Bell Labs! I've been a part of the CSC since my first year at RIT, and I've pretty much always been our PR guy ever since... I make all the posters you see around GCCIS for the CSC. I'm minoring in economics. My language of choice is Python, though I work almost exclusively in Java, and I want to learn more about Ruby and Groovy. <code>Mac >= *nix >= Windows.</code> Mostly interested in Android development right now, but I'd ultimately be looking to do research. In other news, I'm a big anime nut, a reformed gamer, and a fan of tennis/dodgeball/volleyball respectively.</p>
