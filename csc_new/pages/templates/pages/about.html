		<p><i>President</i> - <a href="mailto:president@csc.cs.rit.edu">president@csc.cs.rit.edu</a></p>
		<p>
			I am a third-year Computer Science student from Cranford, NJ.
			I love anime, puzzles, board games, and puns.
			This is my third year in the CSC: I started off as the Events Coordinator, moved up to VP, and now I'm the President!
			I'm really excited about this semester because the CSC is going through some *huge* organizational changes.
			In the coming semester, get ready to see clearer membership guidelines, the launch of subcommittees, lots of Teacher Talks from GCCIS professors, and much more!
